Project Scope Document: Disaster Recovery Platform
1. Project Overview
Project Name:
Disaster Recovery Platform

Project Description:
A cloud-native platform that predicts, monitors, and responds to natural disasters in real-time using AI/ML models, real-time data ingestion, and an automated notification system. The platform will be built with a microservices architecture, using Docker for containerization and Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) for deployment.

Project Objective:
Create a scalable platform for real-time disaster prediction and response.
Integrate AI/ML for accurate predictions.
Implement a robust notification system for timely alerts.
2. Project Scope
In-Scope:
Data Ingestion Service: Collect real-time data from APIs (e.g., Twitter, weather data).
AI/ML Service: Train and deploy disaster prediction models.
Notification Service: Send alerts based on predictions.
Dashboard: Develop a basic dashboard for data visualization.
Deployment: Containerize services and deploy on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).
Out-of-Scope:
Complex user management and third-party integrations.
Mobile applications.
3. Deliverables
Major Deliverables:
Data ingestion service, AI/ML models, notification service, and a basic dashboard.
Containerized microservices and deployment on AKS.
Documentation covering setup and usage.
4. Project Timeline
Phases and Milestones:
Phase 1 (1 week): Set up Azure services and development environment.
Phase 2 (3 weeks): Develop and test data ingestion and AI/ML services.
Phase 3 (2 weeks): Build notification service and dashboard.
Phase 4 (2 weeks): Integration, testing, and deployment on AKS.
Phase 5 (1 week): Final testing and documentation.
5. Resources
Required:
Cloud Infrastructure: Azure subscription.
Development Tools: Docker, VSCode, Git, Azure DevOps.
APIs: Access to Twitter API, weather data APIs.
6. Risks and Assumptions
